listbox:
* make the string list generate insert commands

deep problems:
* toplevel reconstruction
  -- when the user uses something other than "$top",
     you need to be able to update the cage and make it work

architectural problems:
* segregate out "node.py", and make it a little bit more isolated, in terms of the code generation process
  * "tree.py" -- about parsing the tree
  * "gridding.py" -- about parsing the gridding
  * "node.py" -- about node rendering - separately the grid portion and the original widget portion
